Sentiment Analysis Using BERT 

Project Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis of text data using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The goal is to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral by leveraging the power of BERT for natural language understanding. Additionally, Bayesian Optimization is employed for hyperparameter fine-tuning to optimize model performance.

Features

Preprocessing and Cleaning: Effective data preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, removal of noise, and text normalization.

Model Training: Fine-tuned BERT model for sentiment analysis on labeled datasets.

Feature Extraction: Leveraged BERT embeddings for capturing contextual relationships in text.

Bayesian Optimization: Applied for hyperparameter tuning to achieve better model accuracy and efficiency.

High Accuracy: Demonstrated significant accuracy in sentiment classification.

Project Workflow

Data Preparation:

Preprocessing raw text data to clean and normalize it.

Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.

Model Development:

Loading a pre-trained BERT model and fine-tuning it on the dataset.

Implementing a classification head for sentiment prediction.

Training and Evaluation:
